    <h2>Two Personas</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A new graduate from business college is looking to open a new hotel in a tourist dense location. As they do
            research on their phone they consider Daniel as an ideal location because of all the local activities
            provide, during the winter they have downhill slopes and cross country skiing while in the summer there are
            lots of ATVs and dirt bike trails.
        <li>A middle-aged businessman wants to expand his fast-food restaurant and decides to move it to Daniel because
            of the lack of competition. While searching on his computer, there doesn't seem to be many well-known
            fast-food restaurants in the area making his restaurant a great alternative to the local bars and diners.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Do local outdoor activities have deals or partnerships for hotel owners so they can offer their
            customers deals for their services?</li>
        <li>When are the busiest times of year for tourism, and how many people should I expect during those
            times?</li>
        <li>Does the Chamber of Commerce provide advertisement, and how much does it cost?</li>
        <li>I want to connect with local farms and ranches to help provide a lower-cost alternative to
            stocking my kitchens. What kind of options are there?</li>
    </ol>
