      This site will help all those who are interested in solving the iconic Rubik's cube. Many people think that it's a
      lot
      harder than it really is, and by following the steps described on this website anyone can learn to master the
      cube.
    <p>
      Each step, in learning to solve the Rubik's cube is essential and if you are a beginner, we recommend starting by
      learning
      the standard cube notation (link to page). This step will help you learn what each part of the Rubik's cube is
      called as
      well as how we reference them when reading algorithms.
    <p>
      If you already know standard cube notation and just want to jump right into solving the Rubik's cube, head over to
      the
      standard method page (link to page). There you will learn every step in a standard method of solving the Rubik's
      cube,
      it may not be the fastest method out there, but it gets the job done and if you practice enough, you can even get
      times
      under thirty seconds.
    <p>
      Once you have mastered solving the Rubik's cube and are looking for a challenge try putting the Cube into one of
      the unique
      designs found on the patterns page (link to page). This can be a great way to practice reading cube notation and
      looks
      great when you're done.

    <h3>Standard Notation</h3>
    <p>
      The very first step in solving a Rubik's cube is to understand and know each of its many parts. The Rubik's cube
      has
      six sides and they are known as faces, each face is made up of nine stickers of the same color making a total of
      52
      stickers in all. There are three different types of pieces that make up the cube. Center pieces, with only one
      sticker,
      edge pieces with two stickers, and corner pieces with the most at three stickers each.
    </p>
    When you hold the cube, you will want to pick one color to be the bottom face. This is known as the down face and is
    represented by the letter “D”. The face on top is your 'Up face', which is represented by a U. The faces in your
    right
    and left hand are represented by the letters 'R' and 'L' respectively and the back and front faces by the letter “B”
    and
    the letter “F”. Each of these letters represents which side you will turn clockwise unless there is an apostrophe
    after
    it then it will be counterclockwise. For example, if you see (R L R') you will turn the right face clockwise
    followed by
    the left face clockwise, and end with the right face counterclockwise. If there is a two after a letter you simply
    turn
    that face two times.
    </p>
    Each set of letters that represent turns is known as an algorithm. You will learn and memorize many algorithms as
    you
    practice solving the Rubik's cube. Here are some algorithms that you can practice with if you feel that you are not
    ready
    to read the more complex ones.

    (R U R' U')
    (L' U' L U)
    (B R B' R')

    <h3>Solution Page</h3>
    <p>
      When solving a Rubik's cube, you're going to want to start by picking which color you want to solve first, it
      doesn't matter
      what color it is but once you pick a starting color, stick with it until the end. To find what face your starting
      color is,
      locate the center piece that it matches then rotate the entire cube until your chosen color center piece is on the
      bottom face.
      This is how you will hold the cube for all of the steps.
    <p>
      Step 1: The Cross
    <p>
      The first step involves solving the four edge pieces that have your starting color, in the picture you can see
      that I have
      the four white edges lined up with all the corresponding centers. Sadly there are no algorithms for this step
      which makes it
      one of the hardest steps in the whole process, but with some good experimentation and trial and error, anyone can
      learn how
      to solve the first cross.
    <p>
      Step 2: Starting Color Corners
    <p>
      Now that you have your first cross and all your starting color edges lined up, the next step is to solve your
      starting color
      corner pieces. First, you need to find one of the corners that have your starting color, then place it above the
      location it
      needs to go and do the following algorithm.
    <p>
      (R U R' U')
    <p>
      This will put the corner into the right spot but might not be oriented the correct way, however, all you need to
      do is repeat
      the algorithm up to 3 times and that should do the trick. If there are no corners with your starting color in the
      up face look
      in the down face for your desired corners. If the corner is in the down face and needs to come out hold the corner
      in the FRD
      (front, right, down) position and do the algorithm one time, this will move it into the up face and now you can
      move it to the
      desired location.
    <p>
      Step 3: Middle Slice
    <p>
      Now you need to look for edges that share colors that are your front, right, back, and left faces.
      Once you have found an edge, turn the up face until the edge is lined up with the center in the front face. If the
      edge needs to be moved to the right do algorithm A and if it needs to move to the left do algorithm B
    <p>
      A: (U R U' R' F R' F' R) B: (U' L' U L F' L F L')
    <p>
      Step 4: Top Edge Permutation & Orientation
    <p>
      There are three scenarios you will be looking for in the top face and they are as follows, dot, 'L', and line.
      There is a fourth
      possibility and that would be cross, this is what we will be making from the other three scenarios. The algorithm
      for this step
      is (F R U R' F' U') hold each scenario like shown in the picture and do the algorithm, dot will lead into L, and L
      will lead into line
      and the line will lead into a cross.
    <p>
      Once you have the top cross you will turn the up face until two of the edges line up with the centers in the
      front, right, back, or
      left faces. Hold one of the edges that line up in the RU positions and the other needs to be either in the LU or
      BU positions then do
      this algorithm (R U R' U R U2 R') and repeat this step until all the edges are solved.
    <P>
      Step 6: Top Corner Permutation
    <p>
      look at the four remaining corner pieces and look for one that is in the right spot, this does not mean that the
      colors will line up
      you may need to look at the centers of each side and find a corner that just needs to be rotated. Once you have
      located a corner
      That's in the right spot and hold the cube so the desired corner is in the URF position. Then do this algorithm
      until the remaining three
      corners are in their proper positions as well (U R U' L' U R' U' L)
    <p>
      Step 7: Top Conner Orientation
    <p>
      Once all the corners are in the right spot you will only one of them in the TRF position and do the following
      algorithm (D' R' D R)
      repeat this algorithm until the corner is orientated properly. You will notice that this messed up a lot of the
      cube but don't worry,
      turn the up face until another unsolved corner takes the place of the one you just solved and repeat the
      algorithm.
      Once you have repeated this step for all the unsolved corners the cube will be solved.
